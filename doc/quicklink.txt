                        expression and opens an interactive window in which
                        the first four search results of the expression have
                        been listed.

gx                      Open a markdown formated link under the cursor.
                        "NOTE": The default behavior of `gx` when your cursor
                        is over a URL will still work and is unchanged.

gl                      Go to link defintion under cursor.
